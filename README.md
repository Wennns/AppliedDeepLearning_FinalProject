# AppliedDeepLearning_FinalProject

This project aims to build a prediction model for the breast cancer detection using tensorflow. The data source of the image is from CAMELYON16 (https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org), which contains different zoom levels of breast histopathology slides and their corresponding masks that indicates the position of the cancers. </br>
</br>
Methodologies are inspired by the paper “Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images” (Liu et al. ,2017). </br>
</br> 
This is a final project for COMS 4995: Applied Deep Learning taught by Joshua Gordon at Columbia University in Fall 2022. </br>
